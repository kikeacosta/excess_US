Caveats:
"1. Population and rates are labeled 'Not Applicable' when Autopsy, Place of Death, Weekday or Month are grouped by or limited,"
"due to lack of a valid population. More information: http://wonder.cdc.gov/wonder/help/ucd.html#NotApplicableRates."
"2. Data are Suppressed when the data meet the criteria for confidentiality constraints. More information:"
"http://wonder.cdc.gov/wonder/help/ucd.html#Assurance of Confidentiality."
"3. Death rates are flagged as Unreliable when the rate is calculated with a numerator of 20 or less. More information:"
"http://wonder.cdc.gov/wonder/help/ucd.html#Unreliable."
"4. Deaths of persons with Age ""Not Stated"" are included in ""All"" counts and rates, but are not distributed among age groups,"
"so are not included in age-specific counts, age-specific rates or in any age-adjusted rates. More information:"
